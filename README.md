#  Q-Learning in OpenAI Gym's Taxi Environment

This project demonstrates **Q-learning**, a foundational **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** algorithm, applied to the **Taxi-v3** environment from OpenAI Gym.

---

## Project Overview

The agent (a taxi) learns to:

- Pick up a passenger from one location.
- Drop them off at a target location.
- Navigate a grid-world while avoiding penalties.

The agent uses **Q-Learning** to learn the best actions through trial and error.
